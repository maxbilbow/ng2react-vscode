# ng2react (AngularJS to React)

> An experimental extension for converting AngularJS to React, leveraging OpenAI's GPT API.

## Features

- **Convert AngularJS Components**: The plugin allows users to easily convert AngularJS components to React components by sending the components to the ng2react core library, which uses TypeScript for parsing AngularJS components and the OpenAI API to generate the React version of the component.

## Requirements

- **OpenAI API Key**: The plugin requires an OpenAI API key to be set in the `ng2react.apiKey` setting. You can get an API key by signing up for the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/).

This extension contributes the following settings:
* `ng2react.openai.apiKey`: The OpenAI API key to use for generating React components from AngularJS components.
* `ng2react.openai.model`: The OpenAI engine to use for generating React components from AngularJS components. Defaults to `gpt-4`.
* `ng2react.openai.temperature`: The OpenAI temperature to use for generating React components from AngularJS components. Defaults to `0.2`.
* `ng2react.openai.orginization`: An optional organization ID assiciated with your OpenAI account. 
* `ng2react.sourceRoot`: The source root of your AngularJS project. Defaults to `src`.
* `ng2react.enabled`: Whether or not the extension is enabled. Defaults to `auto`.

## Known Issues

This is an early aplpha release of the extension. There are many known issues and limitations, including:
* AI Generated Code: The generated code is not guaranteed to be correct. It is generated by an AI model and may contain bugs.
* Limited Support: The extension currently only supports converting AngularJS components to React components. It does not support converting AngularJS services, directives, or other types of AngularJS code.
