Here is the converted functional React element in TypeScript:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface StateBindingExampleProps {
  twoWayBinding: boolean;
  onTwoWayBindingChange: (value: boolean) => void;
  oneWayBinding: boolean;
  stringBinding: string;
  optionalOneWayBinding?: boolean;
  optionalTwoWayBinding?: boolean;
  onOptionalTwoWayBindingChange?: (value: boolean) => void;
  optionalStringBinding?: string;
  readOnlyOneWayBinding: boolean;
}

const StateBindingExample: React.FC<StateBindingExampleProps> = ({
  twoWayBinding,
  onTwoWayBindingChange,
  oneWayBinding,
  stringBinding,
  optionalOneWayBinding,
  optionalTwoWayBinding,
  onOptionalTwoWayBindingChange,
  optionalStringBinding,
  readOnlyOneWayBinding,
}) => {
  const [changeCounter, setChangeCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setChangeCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
  }, [
    twoWayBinding,
    oneWayBinding,
    stringBinding,
    optionalOneWayBinding,
    optionalTwoWayBinding,
    optionalStringBinding,
    readOnlyOneWayBinding,
  ]);

  return (
    <div className="stateBinding">
      <div>
        <label>
          2-Way Binding{' '}
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={twoWayBinding}
            onChange={(e) => onTwoWayBindingChange(e.target.checked)}
          />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          1-Way Binding{' '}
          <input type="checkbox" checked={oneWayBinding} readOnly />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          String Binding <input type="text" value={stringBinding} readOnly />
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          2-Way Binding (optional){' '}
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={optionalTwoWayBinding}
            onChange={(e) => onOptionalTwoWayBindingChange?.(e.target.checked)}
          />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          1-Way Binding (optional){' '}
          <input type="checkbox" checked={optionalOneWayBinding} readOnly />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          String Binding (optional){' '}
          <input type="text" value={optionalStringBinding} readOnly />
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          Readonly 1-Way Binding{' '}
          <input type="checkbox" checked={readOnlyOneWayBinding} disabled />
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          onChanges Counter <pre>{changeCounter}</pre>
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default StateBindingExample;
```

Assumptions and potential issues:

1. I assumed that the `MyCtrl` controller does not contain any additional logic, so I didn't include it in the React component. If there is any logic in the controller, it should be added to the React component using hooks or other React patterns.

2. AngularJS two-way bindings were replaced with a combination of a value and a callback function to handle changes. This is a common pattern in React for handling two-way data binding.

3. AngularJS one-way bindings were replaced with read-only input elements in React. This ensures that the values are displayed but cannot be changed by the user.

4. AngularJS string bindings were replaced with read-only input elements in React. This ensures that the values are displayed but cannot be changed by the user.

5. AngularJS optional bindings were replaced with optional props in React. This allows the parent component to decide whether to pass the prop or not.

6. The `changeCounter` state variable was added to keep track of the number of changes in the component's props. This is similar to the `$onChanges` lifecycle hook in AngularJS. However, this might not be the most efficient way to track changes in React, as it will cause a re-render every time the counter is updated. If this is a concern, you can consider using other methods like `useMemo` or `useCallback` to optimize the component's performance.

7. The template was converted to JSX syntax and included directly in the React component. This is a common pattern in React, as it allows for better integration between the component's logic and its markup.
